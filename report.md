## Work distribution
Mats did the programming while Linus helped with debugging, testing if things like preprocessing worked and writing the report.

## Design
We tried preprocessing the data with erosion and dilation to get rid of some of the noise, but the results werent great so we decided against using it for the final project. We also noticed some of the labels didnt match up with what we assumed to humbers to be and some of the boxes werent on top of where we would place the number so that could be a source of error when it comes to accuracy, however we didnt find a good fix against this so for now it will just be left as is. 

## Models
All the models can be found in [/Models](/uib.inf265.project2/models/). We trained up four models(v0 adam was just to test things and not really used later on) and tested different learning rates and amount of epochs before we settled on these. In the beginnning we had some issues with our models always returning 0 as the number due to too high of a learning rate, but we got that fixed. As can be seen in the accuracy tests the accuracy is the best on adam v2:

After ten epochs the scores for the model on training, validation and test data are:
